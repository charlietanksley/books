# About

Working through Joe Armstrong's _Programming Erlang_.

## A few notes:

* I'm skipping the Makefile stuff in Chapter 6. I'm not certain, but I
  think there are a couple of more modern options (like rebar) that
  obsolete Makefiles.
* I didn't do the problems in 8.11 because I have no idea how to
  tackle them right now. I feel woefully unprepared for them. Maybe
  I'll come back to them.
